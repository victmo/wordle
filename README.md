# Wordle

This is my implementation of the game [Wordle](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) by Josh Wardle.

Nothing special here, just a Vite app that can be started using `pnpm dev` (or whatever package manager you prefer).

## Why

No particular reason, I guess I was bored.

## TODO

- [ ] Get catalogue of [words](https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/a03ef2cba789d8cf00c08f767e0fad7b)
- [ ] Get list of allowed [guesses](https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/cdcdf777450c5b5301e439061d29694c#file-wordle-allowed-guesses-txt)
